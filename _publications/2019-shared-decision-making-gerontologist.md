As cognitive decline progresses and the necessity for nursing home placement becomes more apparent, the involvement of persons with dementia (PWDs) in the decision-making about housing and care relocation tends to diminish ...

We performed a qualitative data analysis to assess the extent to which housing and care relocation decisions for PWDs with their formal and informal caregivers correspond to an interprofessional shared decision making (IP-SDM) approach, and what light this approach sheds on their experiences with decision making. We used the IP-SDM model to content-code and analyze data from 4 care networks, each consisting of a PWD, 2 informal and 2 formal caregivers. Decision-making in all networks corresponded to most IP-SDM elements, but never included all network members … 

Timely and honest communication helps to mitigate the distress of deciding against patient preferences, as could advance care planning about future housing transitions.
